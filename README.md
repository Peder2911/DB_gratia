# DB gratia

:pencil: This package makes it possible to "apply" functions to very large datasets, by manipulating them piecewise, in chunks. Several functions are available for reading and writing from Redis, using redux.

:bomb: Not very stable, or extensively tested. Currently only working as well as it needs to, though i plan to make this alot smoother in the future. Lots of known bugs.
