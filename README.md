This package makes it possible to "apply" functions to very large datasets, by manipulating them piecewise, in chunks. Several functions are available for reading and writing from Redis, through the excellent redux-package, which is required to use.

Not very stable, or extensively tested. Currently only working as well as it needs to, though i plan to make this alot smoother in the future.

Used for my masters thesis.
